# Bluetooth-Chat-App
This app is a Bluetooth chat application. This will allow the users to chat with each other via Bluetooth. The aim of this app is to revive the usage of Bluetooth again. This app will enable users to chat even if you don’t have internet services on your phone. This type of app doesn’t require you to have any wifi-connection. All it needs is two Bluetooth-compatible Android devices in a range of about 50 feet from each other.
